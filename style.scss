/* (Native CSS comment)
    Hey there! I'm Jyotirmay Patel, the author of this website. I've done a lot of commenting on the code files for you to understand my approach for this website's architecture. Also I would like to mention the instructor whose tutorials helped me build-up my skills to the level-up where I'm currently. A big shoutout to Jonas Schmedtmann (https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman)

// (Sass comment) I'm using Sass to style up my website

// I am also making this website through a COMPONENT-DRIVEN DESIGN approach, that's why I'm using SASS and BEM(for classes)

// For WEBSITE Architecture, I'm using the "7-1 SASS PATTERN" for files and folders.
