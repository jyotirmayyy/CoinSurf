# CoinSurf

CoinSurf is a frontend project made purely using HTML and Sass.

This webpage is responsive, aesthetic, follows the latest design trends, and consists of soothing animations (also for micro-interactions).

I've used a blue-colored theme as it represents stability, trust, and serenity which is ideal for a financial page. I've also used Poppins for the text, which is a geometric typeface considered a highly readable font.
